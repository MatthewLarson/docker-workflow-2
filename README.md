# FILE MOVER/RENAMER #
This is a sample project using a workflow to call some bash code which copies files of a certain type from the src folder to the dist folder and then changes the file extension from .tsv to .txt

I will be using this workflow in a plugin for LackeyCCG which requires tsv files to have txt file extensions.
